# Icebreaker :snowflake: :hammer: 

---

## Icebreaker
You will be split into breakout rooms for **10 minutes**.

- Introduce yourself (name, subjects, degree/major, place)
- Answer: _What is an interesting / unique fact about you?_
- Write that answer into the [padlet](https://padlet.com/lsproductions0/jx5x6z1evxue1a1f) (can be anonymous)

Try to make friends / study buddies!

---

# C and Algorithms

---

## Intro to Algorithms
What is an algorithm?
- set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Not all equal: Speed, Memory, Performance

---

## Why C?
- A simple, low-level, compiled language
- [Much faster](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/python3-gcc.html) than interpreted languages (Python)
- But not as friendly...

---

## Why C for Algorithms?
We implement algorithms in low-level languages:
- fast
- need "full control" of memory & resources
- design own abstractions

Then, can use these algorithms as libraries for other languages (eg: Python).

---

## Developing Locally
- [Running C Programs in the FEIT Labs (and on your home PC)](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/107518/modules/items/2672099)
- [C Programming with Mac](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/107518/modules/items/2672100)
- [Running Programs via Interactive Shells - LMS](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/107518/pages/running-programs-via-interactive-shells?module_item_id=2672101)

---

## `Hello world`
A **boilerplate** for your C program.
```c=
// Liam Saliba (Student No.) 2021-03-08
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Print out a greeting
    printf("Hello world\n");
    return 0;
}
```

---

## A program needs
- Authorship declaration (name, author, description, date)
- `#include` libraries
    - `<stdio.h>` is standard I/O (`man stdio`)
- `main` function
    - `return 0` - success
    - non-zero - some kind of error

---

### Compiling and running your program
Compile your program from source
```shell=bash
gcc -Wall filename.c -o program
```
Run your compiled program
```
./program
```

---

# Review of Lectures

This next part will be pretty quick.  You have the slides, go over them again if you need to during the workshop component.

---

## I/O and Control Flow
```c=
#include <stdio.h>
#define LEGAL_AGE 18

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int age;
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);

    if (age < LEGAL_AGE) {
        printf("You're too young to enter!\n");
    } else if (age == LEGAL_AGE) {
        printf("You're _just_ old enough to enter!\n");
    } else {
        printf("You're old enough to enter. "
              "(Or you lied about your age.)\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Variables
```c
// declaration
int k;

// assignment
k = 5;

// evaluation & reassignment
k *= 2;
```

What is the value of `k`?


---

## Types
type | eg
-- | -- 
int | 1 
float | 1.04 (16-bit)
double | 1.04 (32-bit)
char | 'c'

We prefer `double`s to `float`s.  Change types by **casting**.

```c
(double) x
```



---

## Format specifiers
type | specifier | how to remember
-- | -- | --
`int` | `%d`, `%i` | integer, decimal (base 10)
`char` | `%c` | character
`float` | `%f` | float
`double` | `%lf` | long float

---

```c=
#include <stdio.h>
#define MARY "Mary, Mary, quite contrary"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int n=12345; double x=3.14159; char c='a';
    printf("%d  %3d  %6d  %-6d\n", n, n, n, n);
    printf("%f  %.4f  %6.2f  %-6.2f\n", x, x, x, x);
    printf("%c  %d  %c\n", c, c, c+3);
    printf("%s|\n%50s|\n%-50s|\n", MARY, MARY, MARY);
    return 0;
}
```

```
12345  12345   12345  12345 
3.141590  3.1416    3.14  3.14  
a  97  d
Mary, Mary, quite contrary|
                        Mary, Mary, quite contrary|
Mary, Mary, quite contrary                        |
```

<!-- For later...

`unsigned int` | `%u` | unsigned -->

---

## Escape characters
char | meaning
-- | --
`\n` | newline
`\\` | backslash `\`
`\t` | horizontal tab
`\r` | carriage return
`\'` | quotation mark `'`
`\"` | double quotation mark `"`
`%%` | percent `%`


---

## `scanf`
Reads in from input (`stdin`).  When reading numeric data, will **skip whitespaces** (newlines, spaces, ...).

Returns the number of arguments that were successfully read in.  NOT **what** was read in!

```c
scanf("%d+%d=%d", &x, &y, &z)
```
input | return value
-- | --
1+2=3 | 3
1+    | 1
x     | 0
a1+2=3| 0

More on this next week.

---

<!-- (Probably will skip!) -->
```c=
// Read in something of the format x + y = z
int x, y, z;

// Check if the input was valid
if (scanf("%d+%d=%d", &x, &y, &z) == 3) {
    printf("%d + %d = %d : %s\n", x, y, z, 
        x + y == z ? "Correct!" : "Incorrect...");
} else {
    printf("Invalid format, should be x+y=z.\n");
}
```

---

## Constants
Define something that will never change in our program.  **Always `#define` your constants!**
```c=
#define PROMPT "Hello world!"
#define KG_IN_ONE_LB 2.20462
#define CENTS_IN_ONE_DOLLAR 100
#define DATE_SEP '-'
#define SPEED_OF_LIGHT 299792458
```

---

## Logic
C has no built-in `boolean` (True, False).

`1 == 2` is _Falsy_, so becomes **0**. 

`1 == 1` is _Truthy_, so becomes **Non-Zero** (1, -1, 53, ...).  "NZ"

Signal processing: HIGH and LOW.

## Operator Precidence
The order of operations
![](https://i.imgur.com/GpPTqQa.png)

Test yourself later:  What does the following evaluate to?
```
1 && - 2 * - 3 - 4 < 5 && 6 <= 7 >= 8 != 9 / 10 > ! 11
```
<!-- 0, int -->

---

# What students get wrong!
- forgot to compile before running
- forgot `;` after a statement
- assign variables before declaring them
- treat `scanf` like `input` (both input & output)
- `'` and `"` mean different things (chars, strings)
- can't add strings together with `+`
- missing `( )` and `{ }` for code blocks
- `elif`, not `else if`
- missing `main` function!
- integer division (`int` / `int` = `int`)
- `=` used for equality (`==`)

<!-- practice! -->

---

## Why we need `;`
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {printf("Hello world\n"); return 0;}
```

---

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int
main
(
int
argc
,
char
*
argv
[]
)
{
printf
(
"H"
"e"
"l"
"lo world\n"
)
;
return
0
;
}
```

---

## What to really look out for
- Type limits & overflow
- Integer division
- Floating point precision can be nasty

---

## Type limits
Integers will overflow silently!

```c=
int x = 2147483647;
long y = x;
printf("int: %d + 1 = %d\n", x, x + 1);
printf("long: %ld + 1 = %ld\n", y, y + 1);
```
```
int: 2147483647 + 1 = -2147483648
long: 2147483647 + 1 = 2147483648
```

---

type | eg | min limit | max limit | note
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
int | 1 | -2<sup>31</sup> | 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 | 32-bit
long | 1 | -2<sup>63</sup> | 2<sup>63</sup> - 1 | 64-bit
float | 1.04 |  | | 16-bit
double | 1.04 | | | 32-bit
char | 'c' | -128 | 127 | 8-bit

---

## Integer division
`int op int = int`, even if `op` is **division**!
will _truncate_ decimal places (NOT round.)
```c
printf("%d\n", 3 / 2 == 1.5);  // 0 (False)
printf("%d\n", 3 / 2 == 1);    // 1 (NZ: True)
```
Just ensure one of the operands is a `float` (`double`).
```c
printf("%d\n", 3. / 2 == 1.5); // 1 (NZ: True)
printf("%d\n", 3 / 2. == 1.5); // 1 (NZ: True)
```

---

### Operators
![](https://i.imgur.com/aqBUuwF.png)
*Operations on Numeric values - Table 2.1 (Page 20)*

---

## Floating point precision
```c
double x = 0.1, y = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    y += x;
}
printf("0.1 * 10 = %.20lf (1?)\n", y);
```

---

## Floating point precision
```c
double x = 0.1, y = 0;
// add 0.1 ten times
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    y += x;
}
printf("0.1 * 10 = %.20lf (1?)\n", y);
// 0.1 * 10 = 0.99999999999999988898 (1?)
```

Why? In decimal:
`1/3 * 3 = 0.3333333 * 3 = 0.999999 != 1.`

---

## Floating point equality
```c=
#include <math.h>
#define EPSILON 0.000001

// Returns true if a and b are approximately equal.
int dbl_equal(double a, double b) {
    if (fabs(a - b) < EPSILON) {
        return 1; // They're equal
    } else {
        return 0; // They're not equal!
    }
}

int dbl_equal2(double a, double b) {
    return fabs(a - b) < EPSILON;
}
```
